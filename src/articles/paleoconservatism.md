## Paleoconservatism

Paleoconservatism is a political ideology that combines elements of conservatism with a skepticism of modernity and globalism. Paleoconservatives generally believe that the traditional values and institutions of society are being threatened by the forces of modernization and globalization, and that these threats need to be resisted.

Paleoconservatives often advocate for a smaller, more limited government that is less involved in the lives of individuals and more focused on protecting the traditional values and culture of society. They also tend to be critical of free trade and globalization, and may support protectionist economic policies.

Paleoconservatism is often associated with a nostalgicist and nostalgicist vision of the past, and may be characterized by an emphasis on preserving traditional social and cultural norms, as well as a skepticism of immigration and cultural diversity. It is sometimes distinguished from other forms of conservatism, such as classical liberalism and social conservatism, which may place a greater emphasis on individual rights and free markets.
