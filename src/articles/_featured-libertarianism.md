Libertarianism is a political ideology that advocates for individual freedom and liberty, and for a limited role for government in society. Libertarians believe that individuals have the right to be free from interference by the state or other authority, and that they should be able to live their lives as they see fit as long as they do not harm others.

Libertarians support the idea of a free market economy in which individuals and businesses are free to pursue their own interests and goals, and they generally oppose government intervention in the economy. They also advocate for the protection of individual rights, including the right to private property, and for a limited role for government in protecting these rights.

Today, libertarianism is considered an ideology on the [right of the politcal spectrum](/tag/right-wing). It is closely aligned with the economics of [conservatism](/politics/conservatism) while generally rejecting the social ideas of [social conservatism](/politics/social-conservatism).

## Left-wing Libertarianism

There are many different versions of libertarianism, ranging from more individualistic forms that prioritize personal freedom and autonomy to more collectivist forms that emphasize the importance of community and cooperation. Despite its emphasis on individual freedom, libertarianism is sometimes criticized for ignoring the social and economic aspects of society.

The term "libertarian" originally was used to describe [left-wing](/tag/left-wing), anti-authoritarians such as [anarchists](/politics/anarchism) and [libertarian socialists](/politics/libertarian-socialism). While these ideologies share the same name, they are antithetical to each other; libertarian socialists and libertarians are on opposing sides of the political spectrum.

## Influence

Libertarianism has had a significant influence on political and economic thought, and has inspired various political movements and organizations around the world. It is often contrasted with socialism, which advocates for the public ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, and with conservatism, which emphasizes tradition, social order, and the protection of authority.
