Libertarianism is a political ideology that advocates for individual freedom and liberty, and for a limited role for government in society. Libertarians believe that individuals have the right to be free from interference by the state or other authority, and that they should be able to live their lives as they see fit as long as they do not harm others.

Libertarians support the idea of a free market economy in which individuals and businesses are free to pursue their own interests and goals, and they generally oppose government intervention in the economy. They also advocate for the protection of individual rights, including the right to private property, and for a limited role for government in protecting these rights.

Today, libertarianism is considered an ideology on the [right of the politcal spectrum](/tag/right-wing). It is closely aligned with the economics of [conservatism](/politics/conservatism) while generally rejecting the social ideas of [social conservatism](/politics/social-conservatism).

## Left-wing Libertarianism

There are many different versions of libertarianism, ranging from more individualistic forms that prioritize personal freedom and autonomy to more collectivist forms that emphasize the importance of community and cooperation. Despite its emphasis on individual freedom, libertarianism is sometimes criticized for ignoring the social and economic aspects of society.

The term "libertarian" originally was used to describe [left-wing](/tag/left-wing), anti-authoritarians such as [anarchists](/politics/anarchism) and [libertarian socialists](/politics/libertarian-socialism). While these ideologies share the same name, they are antithetical to each other; libertarian socialists and libertarians are on opposing sides of the political spectrum.

## Influence

Libertarianism has had a significant influence on political and economic thought, and has inspired various political movements and organizations around the world. It is often contrasted with socialism, which advocates for the public ownership and control of the means of production and distribution, and with conservatism, which emphasizes tradition, social order, and the protection of authority.

## History of Libertarianism

Here are some prominent historical moments of the libertarian movement:

* The Enlightenment: The Enlightenment was a period of intellectual and philosophical ferment in the 18th century that laid the foundations for modern libertarian thought. Philosophers such as John Locke and Adam Smith argued for the importance of individual liberty and the right to private property.

* The American Revolution: The American Revolution was a pivotal moment in the history of libertarianism, as it marked the first time that a nation was founded on the principles of individual liberty and limited government.

* The publication of "The Road to Serfdom": In 1944, economist Friedrich Hayek published "The Road to Serfdom," a book that critiqued the trend towards central planning and argued for the importance of free markets. The book became a classic of libertarian thought and helped to popularize libertarian ideas.

* The formation of the Libertarian Party: In 1971, the Libertarian Party was founded in the United States, becoming the first successful third party in the country since the end of the Civil War. The party has since become a major force in American politics, advocating for libertarian principles such as limited government, individual liberty, and free markets.

* The rise of the Tea Party: In the early 21st century, the Tea Party movement emerged in the United States, advocating for limited government and fiscal conservatism. The movement has been heavily influenced by libertarian ideas and has helped to bring libertarianism into the mainstream of American politics.
