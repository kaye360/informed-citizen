Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a social and political movement that seeks to address issues of systemic racism and discrimination against black people. The movement was founded in 2013 in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer, and has since grown to become a global movement for racial justice and equality.

The movement seeks to raise awareness about the ways in which black people are disproportionately impacted by police violence, racial profiling, and other forms of discrimination and violence. It also works to advocate for policy changes and reforms that address these issues, and to support and empower black communities.

The movement has been a significant force in raising awareness of issues of racial inequality and injustice and has played a role in shaping public discourse and policy on these issues. While it has received widespread support and has been credited with bringing about important reforms, it has also been the subject of controversy and criticism in some quarters.

Protests, educational campaigns, and social media activism are the primary ways in which the Black Lives Matter movement has been active. It has also been the subject of controversy, with some arguing that it promotes a divisive and extremist agenda. However, the movement has gained widespread support among many people who believe that addressing issues of racial justice and equality is crucial for creating a more fair and just society.

BLM advocates for the rights and dignity of black people and seeks to end racial discrimination and violence against black communities. It uses a variety of tactics, including protests, civil disobedience, and political advocacy, to draw attention to these issues and to push for change.
