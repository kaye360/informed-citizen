Democratic socialism is a political and economic ideology that combines elements of socialism and democracy. It advocates for the public ownership and control of the means of production and distribution of goods and services, but also emphasizes the importance of democracy and political freedom.

Democratic socialists believe that the wealth produced by society should be shared more evenly and that the government should play a central role in redistributing wealth and addressing social and economic inequalities. However, they also believe that the government should be accountable to the people and that individuals should have the right to participate in the decision-making process through a democratic process.

Democratic socialism is often seen as a more moderate form of socialism that seeks to reform capitalism and address social and economic inequalities through democratic means, rather than through revolutionary change. It has been influential in the development of social democratic parties and policies in many countries around the world.

Democratic socialists believe that a more equal and just society can be achieved by placing the major industries and resources under the control of the working class or the community as a whole, rather than allowing them to be controlled by a small group of capitalists for private profit. However, unlike some other forms of socialism, democratic socialism also emphasizes the importance of democracy and political freedoms, and seeks to achieve its goals through democratic means rather than through authoritarian or dictatorial methods.

Democratic socialism is often contrasted with authoritarian or dictatorial forms of socialism, which are characterized by a lack of political freedom and democratic participation. It is also sometimes distinguished from social democracy, which is a form of democratic socialism that seeks to achieve its goals through the reform of capitalism rather than through its overthrow.
