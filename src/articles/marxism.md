Marxism is a political and economic theory developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in the mid-19th century. It is based on the idea that capitalism, which is characterized by the private ownership of the means of production and the exploitation of the working class, is a flawed and unsustainable system. According to Marxism, the inevitable result of capitalism is the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small class of capitalists, while the vast majority of people, the working class, are exploited and oppressed.

Marx and Engels argued that the working class, through a process of class struggle, would eventually overthrow the capitalist system and establish a socialist society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole, rather than by a small group of capitalists. In a socialist society, the wealth produced by the collective efforts of the working class would be distributed more equally, and exploitation and oppression would be abolished.

Marxism has had a significant impact on political and economic thought, and has inspired many political movements and revolutions around the world. However, it has also been the subject of much criticism and controversy.

## History

Marxism is a political and economic theory named after Karl Marx that explains the relationship between capitalism and class relations. It posits that capitalism is inherently exploitative, as it allows a small group of capitalists to accumulate wealth and power by exploiting the labor of the working class.

Marxism sees history as a series of class struggles, with the ruling class using its control of the means of production to exploit the working class and maintain its power. According to Marxist theory, this exploitation can only be ended through the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a socialist or communist society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the working class as a whole.

Marxism has had a significant influence on political and economic thought, and has been a major influence on the development of various socialist and communist movements around the world.
