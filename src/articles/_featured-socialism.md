Socialism is a political and economic theory that advocates for the public ownership and control of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of goods and services. It is based on the idea that resources and wealth should be shared more equally among members of a society, rather than being controlled by a small group of individuals or corporations.

In a socialist society, the means of production are owned and controlled by the working-class; this can through state or other democratic organizations such as unions, councils, or worker-cooperatives. The goal of socialism is to create a more equitable and just society by eliminating the exploitation of the working class and reducing social and economic inequalities.

## Forms of Socialist thought

There are various forms of socialism, broadly speaking these include:

* Democratic socialism, which advocates for a blend of socialist and democratic principles
* Authoritarian socialism, which involves a single-party or authoritarian government controlling the economy. 
* Libertarian socialism, which advocated a combination of individual liberty and democratic economict principle with a minimal or abolished state

Socialism has been influential in shaping various political and economic systems around the world, including in countries such as China, Cuba, and the former Soviet Union. Despite its goals of equality and social justice, socialism has been controversial and has had a mixed record in practice.

Socialist principles have been tried in many various flavours across the world with varying degrees of success. The more commonly known examples are the Marxist-Leninist variations in the USSR, Cuba, and China. Other, lesser known examples include the CNT-FAI anarcho-syndicalists in the Spanish Civil War and market-socialsim in Yugoslavia.

Karl Marx: Marx is perhaps the most well-known socialist thinker, and is credited with developing the theory of socialism that underlies many modern socialist movements. Marx believed that capitalism was inherently exploitative and that a socialist revolution was necessary to bring about a more just and equal society.

Noam Chomsky: Chomsky is an American linguist, philosopher, and political activist who has made significant contributions to the field of linguistics and has written extensively on issues of politics, power, and social justice.
