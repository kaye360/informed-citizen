Libertarian socialism is a political philosophy that combines elements of socialism and libertarianism. It advocates for the abolition of capitalism and the establishment of a society based on the common ownership and control of the means of production, as well as for individual freedom and autonomy.

Libertarian socialists believe that a truly free and just society can only be achieved by getting rid of hierarchies and power imbalances, and by empowering individuals to make their own decisions and shape their own lives. They reject the idea that the state or any other centralized authority should have the power to control the lives of individuals, and advocate for decentralized and participatory forms of decision-making.

There are many different versions of libertarian socialism, ranging from more individualistic forms that prioritize personal freedom and autonomy to more collectivist forms that emphasize the importance of communal ownership and decision-making. 

Despite its emphasis on individual freedom, libertarian socialism is often contrasted with right-libertarianism, which is a form of libertarianism that emphasizes free markets and individual property rights over collective ownership and decision-making.

## Forms of Libertarian Socialism

### Anarchism
Anarchism is a libertarian socialist ideology that advocates for the abolition of the state and the creation of a society based on voluntary cooperation and mutual aid. Anarchists believe that individuals are best equipped to make decisions about their own lives and that the state is inherently oppressive.

### Mutualism
Mutualism is a libertarian socialist ideology that advocates for the mutual ownership of the means of production and the distribution of wealth based on the principle of "to each according to their needs, from each according to their ability." Mutualists believe that individuals should be free to organize themselves in voluntary associations and that the state should be abolished.

### Participatory economics
Participatory economics, or parecon, is a libertarian socialist economic model that advocates for the participation of all individuals in the decision-making processes that affect their lives. Parecon advocates for the common ownership of the means of production and the distribution of wealth based on the principle of "to each according to their contribution."

### Worker Co-operatives
A worker co-operative is a type of business that is owned and democratically owned and controlled by its workers. In a worker co-op, the workers are both the owners and the employees of the business, and they make decisions about how the business is run through a process of collective decision-making. Worker co-ops are often formed with the goal of creating a more equitable and democratic workplace, as they aim to give workers a greater say in how the business is run and a larger share of the profits.

### Georgism
Georgism, also known as geoism or single tax theory, is a political ideology that advocates for the taxation of economic rent (the excess value of land and natural resources above their costs of production) as the sole source of public revenue. Georgists believe that this would create a more just and efficient economic system, as it would eliminate the need for taxes on labor and capital and reduce the concentration of wealth and power.
