Centrist politics is a political ideology that seeks to occupy a middle ground between more extreme ideologies, such as liberalism and conservatism. Centrists generally believe in a balance between individual freedom and social responsibility, and seek to find compromise and common ground between different political viewpoints.

Who counts as a centrist politician will vary widely between different areas as the overton window may be shifted in different areas. For example, the United States is generally more right-wing than most countries; therefore centrist politicians in the USA may actually be right-wing in other countries.

## "Meet in the middle" approach to politics

Centrist parties and politicians often advocate for moderate and pragmatic policies that seek to address issues and problems in a practical and moderate way, rather than adopting more radical or ideological approaches. They may support a mix of liberal and conservative policies, and may seek to balance the interests of different groups and stakeholders.

Opponents of centrist politics argue that implementing a compromise of political agenda leads to incomplete results and that political oppentents may seek to sabotage legislation while also claiming to compromise.

"Middle-of-the-road" politics has played a significant role in many democratic systems, and centrist parties and politicians have often been able to attract support from a broad range of voters. In some countries, centrist parties have been able to form governments or to play a key role in supporting or opposing the policies of other parties.
