Centrist politics is a political ideology that seeks to occupy a middle ground between more extreme ideologies, such as liberalism and conservatism. Centrists generally believe in a balance between individual freedom and social responsibility, and seek to find compromise and common ground between different political viewpoints.

Centrist parties and politicians often advocate for moderate and pragmatic policies that seek to address issues and problems in a practical and moderate way, rather than adopting more radical or ideological approaches. They may support a mix of liberal and conservative policies, and may seek to balance the interests of different groups and stakeholders.

Centrist politics has played a significant role in many democratic systems, and centrist parties and politicians have often been able to attract support from a broad range of voters. In some countries, centrist parties have been able to form governments or to play a key role in supporting or opposing the policies of other parties.
