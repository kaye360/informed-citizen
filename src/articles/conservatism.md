Conservatism is a political ideology that emphasizes tradition, social order, and the protection of authority. It is based on the idea that society and its institutions are the product of a long historical process and that they should be preserved and protected.

Conservatives generally favor a limited role for government, and support the idea of a free market economy in which individuals and businesses are able to pursue their own interests and goals. They also tend to support traditional moral and social values and to resist change and reform.

Conservatism has played a significant role in the development of political and economic systems around the world. It is often contrasted with liberalism, which is a political ideology that emphasizes individual liberty, democracy, and the protection of individual rights, and with socialism, which advocates for the public ownership and control of the means of production and distribution.
