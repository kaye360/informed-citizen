Conservatism is a political ideology that emphasizes tradition, social order, and the protection of authority. It is based on the idea that society and its institutions are the product of a long historical process and that they should be preserved and protected.

Conservatives generally favor a limited role for government, and support the idea of a free market economy in which individuals and businesses are able to pursue their own interests and goals. They also tend to support traditional moral and social values and to resist change and reform.

Conservatism has played a significant role in the development of political and economic systems around the world. It is often contrasted with liberalism, which is a political ideology that emphasizes individual liberty, democracy, and the protection of individual rights, and with socialism, which advocates for the public ownership and control of the means of production and distribution.

## History of Conservatism: By the Century

In the late 17th century, the Glorious Revolution in England marked the triumph of parliamentary conservatism over royal absolutism. This established a constitutional monarchy in which the power of the king was limited by law and the authority of Parliament was upheld.

In the late 18th century, the French Revolution marked a major shift in European politics, as the monarchy was overthrown and the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity were embraced. This led to the rise of a more radical form of conservatism that sought to defend traditional values and institutions against the perceived excesses of the revolution.

In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution brought about significant social and economic changes that challenged traditional ways of life. This led to the rise of conservatism as a political force, as many people sought to defend traditional values and institutions against the perceived threats of modernity.

In the 20th century, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union helped to shape the contours of conservatism, as many conservatives came to see communism as an existential threat to traditional values and the American way of life.

Now, in the late 20th century, conservatism underwent a significant shift with the rise of neoliberalism, a form of conservatism that emphasizes free markets, individual liberty, and a limited role for the state. This form of conservatism has been influential in shaping the direction of political debate in many countries around the world. [Social conservatism](/politics/social-conservatism) has also gained traction among right-wing adherents.
