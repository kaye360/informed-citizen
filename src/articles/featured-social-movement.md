## Social Movement

A social movement is a collective effort by a group of people to bring about or resist social, political, economic, or cultural change. Social movements are typically characterized by their use of various tactics, such as protests, civil disobedience, and political lobbying, to bring attention to their cause and to pressure authorities or other decision-makers to make changes.

Social movements can be driven by a wide variety of goals and motivations, including issues related to social justice, civil rights, environmental protection, and economic inequality. They may be organized around specific issues or causes, or they may be more broadly focused on bringing about broader social, political, or cultural change.

Social movements have played a significant role in shaping history and bringing about important social, political, and economic changes. They can be found at all levels of society, from local grassroots efforts to global campaigns involving millions of people.

A social movement is a collective effort by a group of people to bring about or resist social, political, economic, or cultural change. Social movements are characterized by their use of non-institutional means, such as protests, civil disobedience, and advocacy, to achieve their goals.

Social movements can take a variety of forms and can be motivated by a wide range of issues and causes. Some social movements seek to bring about progressive change and to address issues of injustice and inequality, while others seek to preserve traditional values and institutions.

Social movements often involve the participation of large numbers of people and can have a significant impact on society. They can bring about important social, political, and economic changes, and can shape public discourse and policy on various issues. Examples of social movements include the civil rights movement, the women's suffrage movement, and the environmental movement.
