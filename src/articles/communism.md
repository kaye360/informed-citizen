Communism is a political and economic ideology that advocates for the establishment of a classless, stateless society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the community as a whole, rather than by private individuals. 

Under communism, the goal is to create a society in which all people are equal and have access to the resources they need to live a good life, without the exploitation and oppression that are inherent in capitalist societies. The ultimate goal of communism is to create a society in which everyone works according to their ability and receives according to their needs, with no private property or social classes. 

## Devlopment of communist theory

While there many forms of socialism and communism in the 19th century, Communism as a political ideology was developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In their works, Marx and Engels outlined a theory of history and a critique of capitalism that would form the basis of communist thought. 

They argued that capitalism was inherently exploitative and that a socialist revolution was necessary to bring about a more just and equal society. Marx and Engels believed that a communist society, in which the means of production were owned and controlled by the community as a whole, would be the final stage of human social development, and that it would bring about the end of class-based societies and the state. 

While Marx and Engels are credited with developing the theory of communism, the idea of a classless, stateless society has existed in various forms throughout history.

## History of communism

The following are some key moments in the history of communism:

* The 1917 Russian Revolution: This was the first major communist revolution, in which the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian monarchy and established the Soviet Union, the first socialist state in the world.

* The 1949 Chinese Revolution: This was the second major communist revolution, in which the Chinese Communist Party, led by Mao Zedong, overthrew the Nationalist government and established the People's Republic of China.

* The 1959 Cuban Revolution: This was the third major communist revolution, in which Fidel Castro's communist forces overthrew the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and established a socialist state in Cuba.

* The 1975 Cambodian Revolution: This was the fourth major communist revolution, in which the Khmer Rouge, a communist party, took power in Cambodia and established a regime that would go on to commit numerous atrocities.

* The 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution: This was the fifth major communist revolution, in which the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a socialist party, overthrew the US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza and established a socialist government in Nicaragua.
