Liberalism is a political ideology that emphasizes individual liberty, democracy, and the protection of individual rights. It is based on the idea that individuals are the primary unit of society and that they have the right to be free from interference by the state or other authority.

Liberalism supports the idea of a limited government that is responsible for protecting the rights and freedoms of individuals, but that otherwise leaves individuals free to pursue their own interests and goals. It also advocates for the rule of law, the protection of private property, and the free market as the most efficient means of organizing economic activity.

Liberalism has played a significant role in the development of modern democratic societies and has influenced the development of political and economic systems around the world. It is often contrasted with conservatism, which is a political ideology that emphasizes tradition, social order, and the protection of authority, and with socialism, which advocates for the public ownership and control of the means of production and distribution.
